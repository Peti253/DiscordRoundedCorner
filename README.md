## How to use:
You need to have [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) installed!

To install the theme, drag [RoundedCorners.theme.css](https://github.com/Peti253/DiscordRoundedCorner/blob/main/RoundedCorners.theme.css) into the themes folder.
if you don't know where the themes folder is, you can find it under `Settings` > `BetterDiscord` > `Themes`.

#### Which Version to use?
The difference between [RoundedCornersWindows.theme.css](https://github.com/Peti253/DiscordRoundedCorner/blob/main/RoundedCornersWindows.theme.css) and [RoundedCornersLinux.theme.css](https://github.com/Peti253/DiscordRoundedCorner/blob/main/RoundedCornersLinux.theme.css) is the inclusion of the title-bar. While the title-bar is a fixed part of the Discord app in Windows - and is therefore also themed - the Linux version of Discord does not have its own title-bar - which is therefore also not themed.
